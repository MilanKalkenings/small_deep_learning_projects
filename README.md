# collection of small scale deep learning projects

## unet transfer
- implementation of a (small) unet architecture
- pretraining of the downwards part with image classification
- fine tuning on image segmentation data in two stages:
  1. adjusting a unet upwards part with frozen pretrained downwards part
  2. end-to-end fine tuning of the downwards part and the upwards part
  
  
### unet
unets consist of two main components:
- **downwards:** each of its blocks decreases the spatial resolution and increases the channel dimension. creates a low-resolution representation of the input
- **upwards:** each of its blocks increases the spatial resolution and decreases the channel dimension. usually creates an output of the same dimensionality as the input to the downards component

unets have skip-connections between the downwards blocks and the upwards blocks to improve the gradient flow to the first layers during backprop.
the skip connections concatenate the outputs of downwards blocks with outputs of upwards blocks that are of the same dimensionality.

## mimo cls
- implementation of a MIMO (Multi-Input Multi-Output) Ensemble
- cifar10 data loading for MIMO ensembles

### mimo
- implicit ensemble that learns independent subnetworks within one neural network
- exploits network capacity
- M ensemble predictions with a single forward pass
- few more time and space complexity (less than 1%), but can converge in independent subnetworks with decorrelated errors/high disagreement
- M ensemble predictions allow uncertainty measure
- MIMO paper: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=OGg9XnKxFAH


## mc dropout 
- implementation of a monte carlo dropout CNN on MNIST
- mc dropout drops out certain activations not only during training but also in inference. Multiple forward passes create ensemble predictions that can be averaged to increase the generalization ability
- performed 10 runs to compare monte carlo ensembles of different size with a normal dropout baseline
- mc dropout paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142.pdf

## cotton TripletMarginLoss
- implementation of a multihead resnet
- cls head classifies cotton plants (healthy, powdy mildew, aphids, army worm, bacterial blight, target spot)
- emb head creates 2d latent space using the TripletMarginLoss
- hard triplet mining

### triplet margin loss
- takes a triplet of embeddings:
  - $a$ = anchor (embedding of a data point)
  - $p$ = positive (embedding of a data point of same class as $a$)
  - $n$ = negative (embedding of a data point of different class as $a$)
- $L(a, p, n) = max(d(a, p) - d(a, n) + \alpha, 0)$ (with $d$ being a distance, \alpha a desired margin)
- learns to fulfill $d(a, p) + \alpha < d(a, n)$

### hard triplet mining
- find $p$ so that $p$ is the **most different** embedding to $a$ of **same class**
- find $n$ so that $n$ is the *most similar** embedding to $a$ of **different class**


## bert mlm
- fine tuning of a pretrained bert model with masked language modeling (mlm)
- data set: [turkey and syria earthquake tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/turkey-earthquake-tweets)

### mlm
- texts are split into tokens ((sub-) words)
- each token is masked with a certain probability (usually 15%)
- model "fills the gaps" with tokens (simple classification to check if the predicted token is correct)
